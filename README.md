## Project Analysis
### User profile:
#### Description:
A target user for this CV website might be a recruiting agent or a potential client looking to evaluate my skills and experience.
#### User expectations:
This website ought to present a CV such that:
- the users get access to information about my professonal experience and relevant skills.
- the information is well structured and easy to access.
- the information is presented in a professional manner.

### Information architecture: 
This website is a single-page static site, designed to present the information in several sections, providing a clearer user experience. The sections will include the following information:

The website opens with a **Header** section, displaying my name, a professional photo, and basic contact details. Directly below, an **About Me** section offers a brief description of myself, my background, goals, and ambitions. These first two sections are very important, as making a good first impression is crucial.

Next, a **Formal Education** section outlines my academic background, primarily university level education, but it also includes any other notable academic achievements. This is followed by an **Employment History** section, which provides an insight into my professional experience, including past roles and responsibilities.

The **Skills** section follows, showcasing my technical and soft skills in an easy-to-read format, allowing users to quickly assess my competencies and strengths. Next, a **Portfolio** section links to some of my projects, giving users direct access to examples of my work.

Lastly, an **Other Relevant Information** section provides any other details that don’t fit into the previous sections, such as language proficiency and certifications.

This information architecture prioritizes clarity, simplicity, professionalism, and a logical flow, allowing the target user to quickly get the information they need, as they might be a busy professional.


### Visual design:  

In the process of tackling an optimal visual design, I chose a color palette based on the brown background of the header image, so that the website feels cohesive. All text on the website is pure white with 80% opacity, except for my name, to put an emphasis on it

The header of the website uses the image I selected as the background to give a strong first impression and create a visually appealing introduction to the information.

Below the header, the sections are organized with bold titles to be easily recognizable and are separated by horizontal lines, which provide a clear visual structure, make the content easy to navigate.

The sections that include lists are presented as bulleted lists to make information more scannable and organized, allowing readers to quickly identify key points.

I also included a few images for recognizability. Specifically, I added the logos of the universities I’ve attended to make them easily identifiable for users. Additionally, I used flag icons to represent the languages I speak.

Overall, this website is designed for clarity, cohesion, and visual appeal. By basing the color palette on the header background, using consistent formatting, and adding images and icons, I’ve created a user-friendly experience that highlights key information and leaves a strong first impression.
